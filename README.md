# Instructions:
  1. Open terminal from your linux OS
  2. sudo apt-get install python3 --> ( If python3 is installed already then go ahead with next step )
  3. sudo apt-get install git --> ( If Git is already installed then no problem go ahead with next step )
  4. sudo git clone https://github.com/shamsi9/SHAMSI9-mac-hacker.git  --> ( Copy or give that command in your terminal )
  5. cd SHAMSI9-mac-hacker
  6. sudo python3 shamsi9-mac-hacker.py --help --> ( for list of options or directly you can go with next step )
  7. sudo python3 shamsi9-mac-hacker.py -i interface -m newMac
  8. And that's it. There you go!
